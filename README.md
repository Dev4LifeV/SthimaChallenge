# Debugging

After it's all set up, it's time to test.

I strongly recommend to run the project in Android Studio environment because in this IDE you have all the official support to run Flutter projects.

* Open the project in the Android Studio by accessing "Open an existing project" or "Open an existing Android Studio project" (depending the version of IDE) and then select the folder where you've been placed the project.
* Go to pubspec.yaml and hit the "Pub get" button or type in the terminal "flutter pub get" to get the project dependencies.
* Select an device emulator (AVD Manager) or connect your physical phone to allow the debugging.
* Hit the play button to start debugging.

The platforms that I'm sure that's working are: Android, iOS and web.

To build an web app, run:
flutter build web

To build an Android Package, run:
flutter build apk

To build an iOS App Store Package, run:
flutter build ipa
