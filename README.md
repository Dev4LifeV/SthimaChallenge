# Azumo Challenge

First of all, I'd like to say that this challenge was amazing (I waste a lot of time tapping to find different gifs and that's why I got late).

So, the project runs as well on mobile as on web, the behaviours won't be affected by the platform.

# Editors, IDEs, SDKs

The minimum version of Flutter SDK is 2.2.3 (channel stable)

To be able to run the project, please make sure that the Android SDKs and Flutter SDK it's set up accordingly and Android Studio(recommended) is installed.
Also make sure that the Flutter plugin and Dart plugin are installed in Android Studio.
If you aren't sure, please go to https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install and read the docs.
To set up the editor go to https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor.

# Debugging

After it's all set up, it's time to test.

I strongly recommend to run the project in Android Studio environment because in this IDE you have all the official support to run Flutter projects.

* Open the project in the Android Studio by accessing "Open an existing project" or "Open an existing Android Studio project" (depending the version of IDE) and then select the folder where you've been placed the project.
* Go to pubspec.yaml and hit the "Pub get" button or type in the terminal "flutter pub get" to get the project dependencies.
* Select an device emulator (AVD Manager) or connect your physical phone to allow the debugging.
* Hit the play button to start debugging. 

# Building

The platforms that I'm sure that's working are: Android, iOS and web.

To build a web app, run:
flutter build web

To build a Android Package, run:
flutter build apk

To build a iOS App Store Package, run:
flutter build ipa
